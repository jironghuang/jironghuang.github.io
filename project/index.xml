      <description>Investment Compass (Kindly wait 10 seconds for the entire app to load. Best viewed in Desktop) This serves as a compass for me to visualize the potential returns given the % fall from 52 week high. See my linkedin article here for further explanation on why I think this is a good indicator.
The app consists of 3 tabs. The &amp;lsquo;Visualize&amp;rsquo; tab contains 3 graphs plotting % fall from 52 week high against the expected returns 1 to 3 years later.</description>

      <description>ETFs watchlist In my Ubunutu - Linux laptop, I wrote some R scripts to crawl the yahoo financial data. When the clock strikes midnight, my cronjob task scheduler will execute these scripts in a parallel fashion to extract the data.
Then my script will log into my google account via SSH and paste the crawled data into 1 of the googlesheet tabs. And this is linked to my portfolio allocation, computation and milestones.</description>

      <description>Portfolio Performance since 2 April 18  Include Google Sheet iframe link in future.   An all weather portfolio Note: I carried out a similar analysis as 1 of the posts Iâ€™ve written (https://jirong-huang.netlify.com/post/perm_port/). The difference is that I considered 4 assets (including T-bills) instead of 3. The performance in the post is more reflective of stress-test perfromance (Sharpe, Drawdown Ratio, etc.)
Based on the literature, permanent portfolio is an investment strategy that is able to yield moderate returns and relatively low volatility.</description>
