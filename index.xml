      <description>Embedding D3 interactive charts Part 2 - Testing reading in of file from directory Just having fun - testing to see if I could embed D3 charts in my blog.
Seems like it works too! But I would have to upload the csv under public folder first.
print(getwd())     // set the dimensions and margins of the graph var margin = {top: 10, right: 30, bottom: 30, left: 60}, width = 460 - margin.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy matching with many to many matches without loops</title>

      <description>Fuzzy matching As a computer scientist graduate, I always strive to reduce my computational complexity through parallelization or vectorization!
Explicit loops in data science is the root of evil!
For loops &amp;amp; while loops have their places but definitely not in data science space (fairly broad statement here).
In this post here, I hope to show a really cool example that avoids the dreaded O(n square) complexity.
I will be using fuzzy matching to find the closet match of strings in data-frame 2, df2 against data-frame 1, df1.</description>

      <title>Latest lessons learnt from crawling</title>

      <description>Lessons learnt I just realised that there&amp;rsquo;s a quick way to understand the xpaths&amp;rsquo; patterns.
In the past, usually what I did is to manually eyeball to infer the patterns from the page source or inspect page.
Silly me!
1 quick way to understand the pattern is through the following,
 Right click on an element in a web page that you are interested in and click on &amp;lsquo;inspect&amp;rsquo; Right click on the node and click &amp;lsquo;copy&amp;rsquo; Copy full xpath  And paste to a notepad.</description>

      <title>Free lunch does exist in Singapore - SRS analysis</title>

      <description>SRS analysis I haven&amp;rsquo;t paid much attention to SRS contributions as a way to reduce taxable income. But lately, I realised you could boost investment portfolio returns through this avenue at literally 0 cost.
I find this blog post written by a local finance blogger to be really helpful in understanding the SRS contributions and withdrawal mechanics.
For my own understanding, I also did some quick analysis using google sheet (see &amp;lsquo;Analysis in google sheet&amp;rsquo; section) to evaluate if this works, and to my surprise, I found that free lunch does exist in Singapore!</description>

      <description>Birth of an idea of all places: In the Jungle Having to juggle both work and masters in computer science at the same time, it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to afford any more time to my side projects.
But back in August, I had a break away from both school and work by going back for reservist. As it&amp;rsquo;s really bored in there where I spent most of the time in a small building (with no aircon!</description>

      <description>Setting up a database for my Jarvis As I run more sophiscated trading strategies, I require a proper database for training parameters and records.
Previously, I was using a mix of SQLite, RDA and CSV files - but going forward I will be using Mysql (workbench) to house my data.
Below is an example of database tables for my market neutral strategies. I will be using these tables for the following,</description>

      <title>Market Neutral Strategy - DAX Index and EWG ETF</title>

      <description>DAX index and Germany ETF I will keep it short in this post since I espoused on this strategy a couple of times.
I discovered another market neutral opportunity this month.
And this is based on ratio between Germany DAX index and MSCI based Germany ETF (EWG)
Based on backtest, sharpe ratio is close to 1.16.
The composition between these 2 indexes are largely similar and any significant deviation shouldn’t persist for long.</description>

      <description>Jarvis Humans are imperfect.
Humans are prone to biases.
Humans are dumb.
Humans have egos.
Humans rely on intuitions which are way way overrated.
And all these are blockers to sustainable positive performances in the area of investment portfolio management.
But not all is lost&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve found a way to aid me in my invesment decision making processes.
And that&amp;rsquo;s Jarvis! My expert advisor to advise me what to do in different scenarios.</description>

      <description>UK index and UK ETF I discovered another market neutral opportunity this month.
And this is based on ratio between FTSE 100 index and MSCI based UK ETF (EWU)
Based on backtest, sharpe ratio is close to 0.9.
The composition between these 2 indexes are largely similar and any significant deviation shouldn’t persist for long.
The optimal lookback period for the MA component in bollinger band is approximately 40 days.</description>

      <description>Asset allocation notification I&amp;rsquo;m in the midst of automating/ guiding my life with algorithms (largely inspired by Ray Dalio) - and 1 of the guidelines that I set is on asset allocation,
 Emerging market and Developed Market should be of the same proportion Bonds + Cash proportion should be equivalent to my age. This can deviate in times of crisis when I want to be more opportunistic.  If it deviates from the portfolio policy statement, it will send me a pushover notification to my phone:)</description>

      <description>Email notification I finally bit the bullet and updated my previously hideous email notification!

      <title>Market Neutral Strategy - SnP500 (SPY) to Berkshire Hathaway Ratio</title>

      <description>Market neutral strategy As the negative news pile up (trade wars, slump in economy growths, etc), I sought for market neutral stategies that could perform well in any market environment.
An idea that struck me recently is to exploit the pair between Berkshire and SnP 500 ETF.
The SnP500 ETF/ Berkshire ratio has been falling over the years - insinuating that Berkshire still outperforms the index in the last couple of years.</description>

      <description>Converting NAs to obscure numbers to prevent the data from messing up the recoding. 1 issue that I encounter while I data-munge is that NAs in data seem to mess up my recoding. Here’s a neat swiss army knife utility function I developed recently.

      <description>Loading data with data types When reading static files into R or Python, most of the times we are lazy as we load the data with no regard to the data types.
But in mission critical ETL jobs or Data analytics workflow, data types are quintessential and there’s a fine line between life and death. Ok, I’m exaggerating here.
What I’ve written below is a swiss army knife function to read an excel file: 1st tab is data and 2nd tab is the variable types (e.</description>
