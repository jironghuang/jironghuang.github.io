      <description>Volatility targeting could potentially increase risk-adjusted returns for quantitative strategies Note: Man AHL&amp;rsquo;s framework in this paper is used in the write-up here.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you researched and managed to find a quantitative strategy that suits your risk-reward preferences. How do you further improve your strategy while managing your risk?
A common way in the trend-following and risk parity space is to target risk - also known as volatility targeting.</description>

      <description>Volatility targeting Currently, I&amp;rsquo;ve a suite of toolkits integrated into my Jarvis that advises me on the investing decisions that I&amp;rsquo;ve to make on a daily basis.
On the latest feature I cobbled together on a Saturday evening, 2 weeks ago, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to measure the volatility of my portfolio formally.
Why I&amp;rsquo;m doing this is because managing risks in the form of volatility is easier than targeting returns.</description>
