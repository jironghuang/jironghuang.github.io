      <description>Trend following strategy in futures using non binary forecasts Project motivation As David Ricardo, a British economist in the 19th century once said, ‘cut short your losses and let your profits trend’ allude to the point that trend following as a profitable strategy could exist even back then.
Having read AQR’s papers on the Time Series Momentum (TSMOM, I am keen to explore this topic in the futures space (Moskowitz, T.</description>

      <description>Developing a performance monitoring system for my algorithmic trading system It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to backtest your signals and forecasts on historical data but it&amp;rsquo;s a completely different animal in terms of execution. I have written about this here.
Another important component of setting up an algorithmic trading system is performance monitoring. Some important questions I had in mind while developing this component,
 How do I measure my slippage? Commissions paid?</description>

      <description>Designing, Building and Deploying a Fully Automated Algorithmic Trading System As I developed several inter-day trading/ portfolio management algorithms, I also embarked on a journey in parallel to develop a fully automated execution framework that could satisfy my requirements.
Previously orders were executed manually after signals are generated automatically.
Requirements  A relatively slow trading system triggered by an hourly task scheduler during trading hours. I’m using Linux cron jobs for this.</description>

      <description>Volatility targeting could potentially increase risk-adjusted returns for quantitative strategies Note: Man AHL&amp;rsquo;s framework in this paper is used in the write-up here.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you researched and managed to find a quantitative strategy that suits your risk-reward preferences. How do you further improve your strategy while managing your risk?
A common way in the trend-following and risk parity space is to target risk - also known as volatility targeting.</description>

      <title>Framework for capital allocation</title>

      <description>Framework for capital allocation In this resource starved world, capital is scarce. Every dollar that you own has its place and deserves to be allocated properly.
Currently, I already have a huge chunk of capital tied up in a diversified portfolio levered up to 1.4 times. Portfolio has (&amp;amp; expected to) outperformed/ matched up to market returns with 2 to 3 times lower risk - in terms of standard deviation and drawdown.</description>

      <description>Volatility targeting Currently, I&amp;rsquo;ve a suite of toolkits integrated into my Jarvis that advises me on the investing decisions that I&amp;rsquo;ve to make on a daily basis.
On the latest feature I cobbled together on a Saturday evening, 2 weeks ago, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to measure the volatility of my portfolio formally.
Why I&amp;rsquo;m doing this is because managing risks in the form of volatility is easier than targeting returns.</description>
