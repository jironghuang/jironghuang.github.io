      <description>Hey it’s the world cup season - Tapping into a Machine Learning based paper Once again as a Singaporean citizen, there’re no other choices but to place my bets in Singapore pools. Betting in SG is not my preferred way to grow my wealth because of the crazy ~15% spread in Sg pools. In international sites, the spread is usually close to 3-5%. Oh well, that’s illegal.
But because this is the world cup season, I decide to make some small punts!</description>

      <description>Finding value in Singapore Pools Of all places, this is the last place I expect to find value. But I found it - supposedly!
I compared the Singapore Pools Odds against Fivethirtyeight blog probabilities of teams’ winning various leagues.
The spread in Singpore Pools is often insane. In a typical 1X2 game, the odds is around 15% - as compared to a spread of 3% in overseas betting houses - which btw is illegal in Singapore.</description>
