      <description>Investment Compass (Kindly wait 10 seconds for the entire app to load. Best viewed in Desktop) This serves as a compass for me to visualize the potential returns given the % fall from 52 week high. See my linkedin article here for further explanation on why I think this is a good indicator.
The app consists of 3 tabs. The &amp;lsquo;Visualize&amp;rsquo; tab contains 3 graphs plotting % fall from 52 week high against the expected returns 1 to 3 years later.</description>

      <description>Finally I had some time to sit down to work on the interactive app. From what was an hideous app to a somewhat Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version of an app. (Shhh&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;m not really a User Interface, UI person).
This serves as a compass for me to visualize the potential returns given the % fall from 52 week high. See my linkedin article here for further explanation on why I think this is a good indicator.</description>
