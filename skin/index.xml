      <description>In this section, I&amp;rsquo;ll note all the quantitative decisions I have made in the areas of investing, trading and betting. Money allocated here excludes the portion that I placed in conservative asset allocation.
Skin in the game or put in another way - putting where your mouth aligns with my core belief. Any serious analysis that I feel strongly about should have a stake in the game.
Also, I&amp;rsquo;m of the view that if you make enough calculated bets with positive expected returns in your life, eventually it will be a net positive in the long run.</description>
