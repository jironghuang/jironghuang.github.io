## What're the returns (XIRR) for my CPFIS Portfolio?

Every employee in Singapore is bounded by the same set of CPF rules. 

As an ex-economist/ data geek who doesn't shy away from having skin in the game. I asked myself this question back in 2015 when I was still a starry-eyed young man 2 years into the workforce - how do I set out to optimize my returns in my CPF OA with these given set of constraints,

- You cannot withdraw your CPF OA till you are 55 years old
- You can only invest CPF OA beyond 20k
- And of this delta, you can only invest 35% in non ETFs instruments OR 100% of it in ETFs
- CPF OA returns of 2.5% per annum

The last point is something that I wish to highlight. If I choose to invest, I would have to overcome the 2.5% hurdle rate from CPF OA.

Subscribing to Vanguard's philosophy, a pioneeer & leader in the space of index funds - (https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/s315.pdf) at least for my CPFIS portion, they advocate that lump sum investing proves to be superior than spacing out your investments (dollar cost averaging).

Since then - whenever I have 5-6k in my CPF OA beyond the 20k, I promptly allocated it to the market. In some periods, I invested with smaller amounts when POEMS brokerage offered some promotions on commission fees.

### How did this strategy fare thus far?

XIRR- a metric used in assessing rate of returns with a given set of cashflows - came up to be around 5.7%! Note: This figure here accounts for the dividends received over the years.

Hurray! It's more than twice the 2.5% hurdle rate in CPF OA. And even the 4% rate from SA. One could voluntarily transfer OA to SA, but you will lose the flexibility of using the OA for serving mortage in future

### My thoughts

This is still an ongoing experiment in my 'lab'. Apparently it seems to be working well! Going forward, I will continue this strategy.

### If you are keen in the technicalities of computing XIRR (applied the function developed by someone else here -->#https://github.com/SunilVeeravalli/xirr)...

```{r}
suppressMessages(source("./CPFOA/F_xirr.R"))
suppressMessages(source("./CPFOA/another_irr_eg.R"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tvm))

#Reading my dataset
cpf_contrib <- read_csv(file = "./CPFOA/jr_cpfis_contrib.csv", col_names = TRUE)

#Formattting date
cpf_contrib$Date = as.Date(cpf_contrib$Date, format = "%m/%d/%y")
names(cpf_contrib)[which(names(cpf_contrib) == "Date")] = "dates" 

#including ss
cpf_contrib$net_stocks_purchase = lead(cpf_contrib$num_stocks_cpf_port - lag(cpf_contrib$num_stocks_cpf_port))

#Contributions
cpf_contrib$stock_amt_purchase = cpf_contrib$net_stocks_purchase * cpf_contrib$sti_px

#Dividends amount
cpf_contrib$dividends = cpf_contrib$num_stocks_cpf_port * cpf_contrib$Dividends_per_share 
cpf_contrib$dividends = ifelse(is.na(cpf_contrib$dividends), 0, cpf_contrib$dividends)

#Net cashflow
cpf_contrib = cpf_contrib %>%
                mutate(net_cash_flow = dividends - stock_amt_purchase)

#Setting final cashflow  
cpf_contrib$net_cash_flow[nrow(cpf_contrib)] = cpf_contrib$cpf_oa_port_val[nrow(cpf_contrib)]

#Computing the xirr
xirr(cpf_contrib[, c("dates","net_cash_flow")])
print(xirr2(cpf_contrib$net_cash_flow, cpf_contrib$dates))
```

### Final dataset on dividends, purchases, cashflows, portfolio values
```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(kableExtra))

kable(cpf_contrib, caption = "Final data-frame of dividends, purchase, cashflows, portfolio values")

```
